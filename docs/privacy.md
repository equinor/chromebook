# Privacy related topics

This document gather information related to privacy protecting features, running a chromebook. Seems like a paradox, using ChromeOS/Chrome from Google and protecing our privacy - however, we should not give away our signals because we are using ChromeOS. Thus I hope you will help gather information to tweak the system to send as few as signals as possible.
