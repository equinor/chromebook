# Installing apps

- PWA
- Flatpak
- Deb-files
- Play Store
  - Mostly Android apps and some PWAs (Zoom for Chrome for example)
  - Most Android apps are for phones (Opera is an exception)

A PWA will have an install icon in the right hand side of the address bar. Web apps that are _not_ PWAs can still be “installed” by clicking … → “more tools” → “create shortcut” and then ticking off “Open as window”.
